This Minesweeper game consists of an m*n grid with x number of hidden mines placed randomly on the grid. The user plays a guessing game of clicking cells on the grid as per the following rules:

 
1.If the cell has a bomb underneath, the game is over.
2. If the cell does not have a bomb underneath, a number is displayed on the cell that denotes the number of mines in the adjacent cells.
3. If No adjacent cell has bombs then recursively neighbouring cells are explored.
4. Score is displayed on the basis of number of non-bomb tiles explored.

This is the overall look of the game:
